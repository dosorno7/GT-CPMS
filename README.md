# Client-Project Management System
The Client-Project Management System is a web application for Georgia Tech professors of the Computer Science Junior Design Course. Professors are able to authenticate and log-in to the application using Georgia Tech's SSO Authentication service. The application will allow professors to view and manage project/team/client pairings. They will be able to filter the display and quickly grab the emails for teams, sections, clients, etc. for contacting. As students, professors, clients, and projects come and go, the Client-Project Management System is highly adaptable and allows professors to create, edit, and delete teams in one place.
